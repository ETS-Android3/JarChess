## Installing

Because the game is not yet released, installation requires the use of a development tool called Android Studio. Android Studio can be downloaded on [Android Studio's Website](https://developer.android.com/studio).

After you finish installing Android Studio, go to the [JarChess master branch github page](https://github.com/saunders94/JarChess/tree/master) and click the green "Clone or download" button. Copy the URL, it will be needed soon.

When you Launch android studio, choose "Check out project from version control" and select Git from the drop down menu. You will be asked for a URL, so paste the URL that was copied before. Check that the destination shown is where you want to save the project.

Once you have the project loaded, we need to set up a test device. You can do this by opening the Tools menu and selecting the AVD Manager. Click the "+ Create virtual device..." button. Pick a device from the phone list and click "next". Choose an OS version 5.0 or higher and click next.
